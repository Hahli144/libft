# libft - Our first own library
The aim of this project was to code a C library that we could use in our future projects.

## How to use:
1. Clone the repository.

	``` git clone https://github.com/Hahli144/libft.git ```

2. Compile the library

	``` make all ```
  
The result is a library called libft.a, which can then be linked to a project.
