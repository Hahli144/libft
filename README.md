# libft - Coding our first basic C library
The aim of this project was to code a basic C library that we could use in our future projects.

My other projects, [get_next_line](https://github.com/salahadawi/get_next_line) and [ft_printf](https://github.com/salahadawi/ft_printf) have been added to this library.

## How to use:
1. Clone the repository.

	``` git clone https://github.com/salahadawi/libft.git ```

2. Compile the library

	``` make all ```
  
The result is a library called libft.a, which can then be linked to a project.

## init.py
init.py is a quick script to delete files that are not needed when libft is cloned and used in another repo.

Files currently deleted are README.md, .git directory and it's contents, and the init.py script itself, which is not needed after being executed once.
